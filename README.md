# professor_as_a_service

The Design of a Digital Platform for “Professor-As-A Service”

Format: Team project involving 2 or 3 of your peers.

The objective of this assignment is to instill in you the techniques for turning an object model into a machine for information gathering and data aggregation. We want to use software engineering techniques to reduce tuition cost while improving the quality of education anywhere in the world. We want to hold people accountable for improving the quality of life for the masses through education, learning to learn, and feedback.

Consider the following digital educational model where the professor is at the center of students’ learning (not the university). Let’s call this model: “Professor as a Service” with the following requirements:

The system is totally decentralized where professors own their talent and experience not the educational institution.

- The professor manages their own courses as well as what they want to teach and when to teach them. Students sign up as they please.
- The professor has full autonomy. Likely the professor will be offering courses in their specialty. A reputation index will be available to help aspiring students decide which courses fit best.
- A professor will join the service and operate remotely from anywhere in the world.
- Professor services are visible and accessible from anywhere in the world, using tablets, browsers, smart devices, etc.
- To earn their degree, students must fulfill course requirements which means courses must be taken from many professors (residing anywhere in the world)
- The underlying digital platform offers third party certification authority to approve the degree. You might want to consider different certification authorities.
- One third party might have better access to employers for example.
- Course prices are set by the professor and can vary and easy to adjust depending on demand
- Tuition for courses go directly to the professor. The professor will pay subscription fees for use of the digital platform.

One of your deliverables will be to design a dashboard that enables platform owners to collect performance data of different varieties.

Deliverables

1. Report outlining your proposed solution.
2. Architecture diagram showing the new business model and how it is different from traditional university setup.
3. Screen designs for the different use cases (roles)
4. Sequence diagrams showing how to navigate the university object model to deliver performance metrics needed for performance and feedback.
5. A class diagram showing the changes to the university model to support the new capabilities. This diagram must include the additional methods and attributes required to deliver the results.
6. Overall assessment and opinion on whether such digital educational platforms of the future will make education easily accessible and affordable to the less fortune.
